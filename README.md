# Damn Small Brandubh
I decided to challenge myself in making the smallest version of the Brandubh game.

I honestly should've been studying for my Robotics I exam instead of doing this.

Current output is:
```
Current player is ATTACKER.
Current board:
  A  B  C  D  E  F  G
1 .  .  .  A  .  .  .
2 .  .  .  A  .  .  .
3 .  .  .  D  .  .  .
4 A  A  D  K  D  D  A
5 .  .  .  D  .  .  .
6 .  .  .  A  .  .  .
7 .  .  .  A  .  .  .

Size of game state: 13 bytes.
Size of constants: 4 bytes.
```
and I'm damn proud of that.
